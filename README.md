Simon Says Game 🎮

The Simon Says Game is a fun and interactive browser-based memory game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the game is to test and improve the player’s memory by challenging them to recall and repeat an increasingly complex sequence of colors generated by the system. With each successful round, the sequence grows longer, making the game progressively more challenging and engaging.

This project demonstrates the effective use of core JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, arrays, timing functions, and game state management. The game logic dynamically generates color patterns, tracks user input, validates the player’s responses, and updates the score in real time. Smooth animations and visual feedback enhance the user experience, making the gameplay intuitive and enjoyable.

The user interface is designed using CSS for responsive styling, ensuring the game runs smoothly across different screen sizes and browsers. Clear visual cues, button highlights, and game-over messages help users understand their progress and restart the game easily. The clean and minimal design keeps the focus on gameplay while maintaining an attractive look.

Overall, this project serves as a great example of building an interactive web application using vanilla JavaScript without relying on external libraries. It is ideal for beginners looking to strengthen their understanding of front-end development fundamentals, logical thinking, and real-time user interaction. The Simon Says Game highlights problem-solving skills and showcases the ability to convert game logic into a fully functional web-based application.
